# Lecture Notes on Machine Learning and Data Mining

The files are the syllabus and lecture notes for the course I am teaching at Case Western Reserve University.  The course number is PQHS 471.

## Topics covered

The topics I cover fall in three broad categories:

* Traditional statistical methods relevant to machine learning, including the basics of statistical learning, cross-validation, confusion matrix, LDA/QDA, ridge and lasso regression, splines and local regression.
* Modern machine learning methods, including trees, random forests, boosting, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks.
* Unsupervised learning methods, including clustering, market basket analysis, density estimation, principal components, multi-dimensional scaling, and self-organizing maps.

I mostly use R for class demonstrations.
