# Lecture Notes on Machine Learning and Data Mining

The files are the syllabus and lecture notes for the course I am teaching at Case Western Reserve University in the Spring of 2019.  The course number is PQHS 471.

## Topics covered

The topics fall in three broad categories:

* Traditional statistical methods relevant to machine learning, including the basics of statistical learning, cross-validation, confusion matrix, LDA/QDA, ridge and lasso regression, splines and local regression.
* Modern machine learning methods, including trees, random forests, boosting, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks.
* Unsupervised learning methods, including clustering, market basket analysis, density estimation, principal components, multi-dimensional scaling, and self-organizing maps.

I use R for most class demonstrations.

## Notes

I keep adding files during the Spring semester.  The notes will be complete by the end of April.  I intend to leave the files here until next Spring.  If you have any suggestions, please send them to cxl791 \@ case \. edu.

Some formula and figures are from the textbooks I use.  Please let me know if this would incur any copyright issues.
